# AutoMate
Website for the AI agency AutoMate

Building out this website was a fantastic experience. I got intimately familiar with JS, Node, Tailwind, Vite and other powerful web developmenmt library and tools - tools I'm continuing to use and I'm excited to show that progress here soon. I'm passionate about AI and process automation, so I decided to build the frontend/landing page for a website that I can use in the future to direct people to services I can offer. Moreover, building AI algorithms or using existing ones in novel ways is one thing - bringing them to production and deployment is another. This project was mainly driven by the fact I wanted to be more familiar with web development so that I can ultimately understand the full MLOps processes (as any AI/ML algos will ultimately be used by end users on the web).

Above you can see the hero section for the  site, but that merely scratches the surface. Getting familiar with how to build a website from scratch and get samiliar with the knitty gritty code, was genuinely fun. Figuring out how to deploy it wasn't as fun, but it was a success - you can view the full website here; http://genesis.rf.gd/
